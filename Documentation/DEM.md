# DEM files documentation

> DEM is probably for "Demo"

A DEM file is bound to a WAD file, they share the same filename (but not the same extension obviously).  
DEM files are only present on levels that support [Demo mode](WAD.md#Demo-mode)
(triggered when you don't use your controller for a minute or so on the title screen), hence their name.

It *could* be linked to Argonaut Strategy Language (ASL).
